## What is this?
This is some kind of template site with catalogized pages that contains some videos.

## Why this exists?
I wanted to use my Nintendo 3DS not only as a game device, and use it like some sort of media player. There video is some sort of issue because i seen no video files players(even homebrew). I decided to use New Nintendo 3DS's browser ability to play HTML5 videos to do this real. 

### kinda tutorial
If you need to grab some videos to play on 3DS you need to use another device to setup an web server with this site(mobile phone  for example) and some kind of network(phone's hotspot is good).

1. Start a server
2. Connect to the same network
3. Open phone's IP adress in Nintendo 3DS browser.
4. ???
5. Profit!
